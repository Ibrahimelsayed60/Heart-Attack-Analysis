# Heart-Attack-Analysis

## About this dataset

- Age : Age of the patient
- Sex : Sex of the patient
- exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
- ca: number of major vessels (0-3)
- cp : Chest Pain type chest pain type
  - Value 1: typical angina
  - Value 2: atypical angina
  - Value 3: non-anginal pain
  - Value 4: asymptomatic
- trtbps : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
- chol : cholestoral in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor
- fbs : (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
- rest_ecg : resting electrocardiographic results
  - Value 0: normal
  - Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
  - Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
- thalach : maximum heart rate achieved
- target : 0= less chance of heart attack 1= more chance of heart attack

## Objective(S)

- With the dataset provided for heart analysis, we have to analyze the possibilities of heart attack on the basis of various features, and then the prediction from the analysis will tell us that whether an individual is prone to heart attack or not.
- The detailed analysis can proceed with the exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- The classification for predication can be done using various machine learning model algorithms, choose the best suited model for heart attack analysis.

## Research Question(S)

- Does the age of a person contribute towards heart attack?
- Are different types of chest pain related to each other or the possibility of getting a heart attack?
- Does high blood pressure increase the risk of heart attack?
- Does the cholesterol level eventually contribute as a risk factor towards heart attack?
